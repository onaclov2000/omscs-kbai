##Semantic Networks##

In their simplest form, Semantic Networks are a data structure usually in the form of a graph. 
Each of the nodes contains infomation, often in the form of a Frame. 
The edges of the graph describe how each node is related to another node. 

One node may connect to another node in multiple ways having multiple edges that each describe some aspect of how each node relates.

An example of a Semantic Network would be the following:



Semantic Networks are often the basis of other AI constructs.
